<h2>About TrackerZone Bot</h2>

<p>Tracker Zone is a Telegram bot. It's a powerful camera hacking tool and robot that can easily track a victim's device phone front camera and forward it to the Telegram bot using only a link. Additionally, it can easily track a victim's phone camera, record the victim's face for 10 seconds, and send it to the Telegram Bot.</p>

<h2>User Privacy:</h2>

<p>I try my best to protect user privacy and security. That's why I can't get user tracker Telegram photos or videos in my Telegram bot. Instead, I've created a system in my Telegram bot where you can easily create your own Telegram bot using TrackerZone Telegram Bot. The best part is it sends all details to your bot, not mine. So, your security is greatly enhanced.</p>

<p>Just open TrackerZone Bot and click start. Here you'll find many options. Choose your desired option by clicking on it to get your tracker link.</p>

<h2>Advanced Features:</h2>

<p>One of the best features is you can shorten any link using this bot. It's not only for tracker links; you can easily shorten any type of link.</p>

<h2>Free Storage:</h2>

<p>You get free storage here. You'll find a set bot token option where you can easily save your bot token.</p>

<h2>Terms:</h2>
